      How it works
Basically this is a game with 13 cards, each card having a value. You have access to all the 13 cards, but you can only choose one card randomly(if you choose to play LUCK) or by testing how good you can memorize(if you choose to play MEMORY). When you choose a card, the value of that card becomes your score so far. If you choose another card, it adds the value of the current card to that of the previous one. But your cards total should not cross 21, if they do you have BUSTED, so you can't pick another card. Now if you bust or if you want to go ahead with the score that you have, its time for the dealer to play. If you are done with a round and want to play another round, just press deal.

Wins, loses and draws logic
If you bust and the dealer busts, its a draw

If your score is the same as the dealer's and you're both under 21, its a draw

If the dealer busts but you don't, you won

If both scores are under 21 but your score is higher than that of the dealer, you won

If you busts but the dealer doesn't, you lose

If both scores are under 21 but your score is less than that of the dealer, you l
