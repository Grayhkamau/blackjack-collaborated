  <p>Basically this is a game with 13 cards, each card having a value.<br> You have access to all the 13 cards, but you can only choose one card<br> randomly(if you choose to play LUCK)<br> or by testing how good you can memorize(if you choose to play <br>MEMORY). When you<br> choose a card, the value of that card becomes your score so far. If you<br> choose another card, it adds the value <br>of the current card to that of the previous one. But your cards total <br>should not cross 21, if they do you have BUSTED,<br> so you can't pick another card. Now if you bust or if you want to go <br>ahead with the score that you have,<br> its time for the dealer to play. If you are done with a round and want<br> to play another round,<br> just press deal.</p>
  
  <div class="header2"><h3>Win,Loses and draw Logic</h3></div>
  <div class="list">
  <li>If you bust and the dealer busts, its a draw</li>
  <li>If your score is the same as the dealer's and you're both under 21, its a draw</li>

<li>If the dealer busts but you don't, you won</li>

<li>If both scores are under 21 but your score is higher than that of the dealer, you won</li>

<li>If you busts but the dealer doesn't, you lose</li>

<li>If both scores are under 21 but your score is less than that of the dealer, you lose</li>
